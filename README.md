# La-Posta-The-Game
Game developed as a project for the high school diploma based on "La Posta" by De Roberto

# La Posta: The Game

La posta is a story about Cirino Valastro, a soldier that's part of a battalion. He doesn't know how to read or write, so he gets the help of lieutenant Malvini to read the letters from his Sicilian family. While they're in the war, the lieutenant starts making up lies from the letter as very bad things happened to Cirino's family. All this because he cared about Cirino and didn't want to make him feel bad without having the possibility to go meet his family.

The game takes place in a mission in which Cirino and other soldiers have to dismantle an enemy turret which was blocking supply trucks, including mail.
